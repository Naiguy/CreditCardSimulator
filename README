Please run either the Driver's main method or the Test's main method.

The Driver will run custom runs of the application
and the Test will run the scenarios presented in the assignment document.

	/*
		 * Original Scenario 2:
		 * 
		 * A customer opens a credit card with a $1,000.00 limit at a 35% APR.
		 * The customer charges $500 on opening day (outstanding balance becomes $500).
		 * 15 days after opening, the customer pays $200 (outstanding balance becomes $300).
		 * 25 days after opening, the customer charges another $100 (outstanding balance becomes $400).
		 * The total outstanding balance owed 30 days after opening should be $411.99.
		 * (500 * 0.35 / 365 * 15) + (300 * 0.35 / 365 * 10) + (400 * 0.35 / 365 * 5) = 11.99
		 * 
		 * Addressed Issues:
		 * One line asks for 30 days after
		 * The total days asked for is 40 (15+25).
		 * The math at the bottom states 15 days after the first charge, 
		 * 10 days after payment, and 5 days after last charge.
		 * 
		 * To simplify, I used the 30 day total of 15,10,5.
